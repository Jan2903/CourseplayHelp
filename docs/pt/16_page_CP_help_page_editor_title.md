# Course editor

  
The course editor can be used to edit courses and custom fields.  
The loaded courses will be saved/overritten automatically, when the editor is closed.  
  
1) Editing a custom field can be done with a selected field on the ai menu page.  
2) Editing a course can be done in the course manager.    
      There you can edit a saved course, but be sure you cleared the currently loaded course from the vehicle.  
  
Editing of course should only be done, when the course generator can't produce a good enough course.  
Incorrect editing might couse problems for the cp driver, as the waypoints have hidden attributes.  


  
Under the basic category are:  
1) The move brush moves a hovered waypoint to the brush position.  
2) The insert brush can insert waypoints ahead or behind of a selected waypoint.  
  
Deleting of waypoints can be done with the red delete button.  


  
Under the advanced category are:  
1) A brush to move multiple waypoints in between to selected waypoints.  
2) A brush to insert a curve of waypoints between to selected waypoints.  
3) A brush to set the turn attribute of a waypoint(only with a course and not a custom field).
