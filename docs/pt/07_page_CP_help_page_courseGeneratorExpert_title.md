# Course generator expert

  
Some settings are only visible, if you set the expert mode to active on the global courseplay settings.  
Before you play arround with those settings, you should make sure you know what the basic settings do.  
Some expert settings only work properly under some conditions.  
  
- Multiple Tools: This setting is used when you want more then just one vehicle to work on your course. As this gets a bit more complicated, there is a separate help topic for it.  
- Field margin: This setting lets you move the field border in- or outwards of the original border.  
- Narrow field: Creates the headland only at two short edges of the field. In that case, it is not possible to keep your vehicle on the field on the longest edges at the headland.  
- Headland overlap: There is a default value that will always be used. This value can be changed with this setting. The overlap will be withing the field and won't overlap the field border.  
- Use base line edge: A completly new feature, what only works on specific fields. If you have a field with a long radial border and place the field marker near it, the center line will follow that border.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: Should the generated course not be perfect or even bad, the selected edge or the field will not work with this feature. There also won't be an Update for this!
