# Extended AI Menu


First you need to select a vehicle in the AI menu for generating a fieldwork course or gaining access to the vehicle settings and the course manager.
The currently loaded course will be displayed on the map.
The global settings are always visible.
For generating a course and starting the courseplay jobs, you will need to create the job CP: Fieldwork or CP: wrap/collect bales, similar to the Giants helper.

To start off with your first CP job, you would have to select a vehicle and a possible valid implement which is supported for the job.
Then, by clicking on create job, you can select CP: Fieldwork for fieldwork tools or CP: wrap/collect
with a bale wrapper or bale collector attached.



With a CP job selected, you would need to place the field position on a field for generating the course or using the bale finder on it.
The position also roughly controls the starting point of your course.
If you want to use the Giants helper to drive to the field, then you also need to set the target position close to the starting point of the course.
The lane offset setting is only used if you want to have multiple helpers working on the same field. For this please checkout the separate help menu page below.

When the field position is placed correctly on a field, you will see the field border drawn on the map.
If you are creating a CP: Fieldwork job, you will gain access to the course generator settings. 



Now it's possible to start the driver directly from the menu. The Giants helper will drive to the target position and from there the CP job automatically takes over.
Alternatively you can also start the driver from the HUD if you are close to the field with the vehicle or using the AutoDrive mod to deliver the CP job close to the field.
