# Course manager

  
  
The course manager allows you to save courses and enables you to load the saved course later again.  
  
This is really important, when you want to have multiple workers driving the same course for convoy (multi tools).  
  
This feature also allows you to pickup the swath left behind by a combine or a windrower with a forage wagon or a baler.  
  
  
  
The save location for the course files is: ..\My Games\FarmingSimulator2022\modSettings\FS22_Courseplay\Courses\Mapname.SampleModMap (or for vanilla e.g. MapUS).  
  
The course manager works differently from what you are used to in FS19.  
  
Courses are saved into folders, which will be displayed on the left. This means you would need at least one folder to start saving courses into.   
  
Folders can simply created by the button at the bottom of the screen and entering a name.  
  
Courses are only saved localy for now.

When you have a course loaded, you can save it by clicking on the save course button and then on the folder. Then a pop up window will appear where you can enter the name of your course.  
  
The name and location can be changed later.  
  
To remove the course from your vehicle, click on 'Clear current course' button.  
  
For loading a course you would have to select the folder first, click on the load course button and then simply clicking on the course you want to load.  
  
Clicking on change mode activates the edit mode of the course manager.  
  


  
  
With the edit mode is active you have these options:  
  
    
- Moving a course into another directory.  
  
    
- Deleting courses or directories.  
  
    
- Renaming courses or directories.
