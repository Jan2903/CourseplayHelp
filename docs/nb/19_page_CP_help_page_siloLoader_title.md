# Silo loading  
With this job it's possible to load from heaps on or near the field.  
Additionally it's possible to load from a bunker silo.  
The loader can be unloaded with an Courseplay unloader.  


  
To start the loading-marker on the AI menu needs to be set.  
The marker detects heaps or silos and highlights them on the map.  
Now it's possible to start the helper.
