# Bunker silo worker

  
Courseplay is able to compact or distribute chaff in a bunker silo or push chaff in a wedge silo.  
Compacting is possible without any special tool, with a roller, weight or just the vehicle.  
For distribution, there are special tools. (e.g. der Fliegel DUO).  
For wedge silos, a shield is used to push the chaff to the back of the silo.  


  
If the vehicle has a distributor or shield attached, the Silo mode is preselected. With only a weight or a roller attached  
you toggle through the starting point until the mode appears.  
Beside the working width, you can also select the direction the driver should drive into the silo. With a shield attached,  
the direction is selected automatically.  
Use the target icon on the HUD to select the silo on the AI Map. If will be shown with blue lines and lights up white if it is selected.  
The parking position is set with the marker "parking position" wich can also be used to drive there with the Giants helper  
before starting the actual work.
