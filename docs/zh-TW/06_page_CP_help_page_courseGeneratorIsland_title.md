# Course generator island

  
  
Driving arround the island is now only possible with a complete round arround it.  
  
Even in the new generator, limits for island too close to the field border.  
  
The work width of the tool is decisive if the island is too close or not.  
  
Like how many headlands do fit between the island and the field border.  
  


  
  
    
- Island bypass: Turns on or off the bypass of the island, if an island is found. This does not work for custom fields!  
  
    
- Island headlands: The amount of rounds arround the island can now be set indipendantly from the headland setting.  
  
    
- Island headland direction: In which direction the driver drives arround the island, to not have strange direction changes. This can be tricky to set up as it depends on the field and the rest of the course.
