# Harvester unloader

  
The unloader mode of Courseplay works with combines, harvesters and towed harvesters driven by Courseplay.  
It does not work with choppers.  
You can either use a regular trailer or an auger wagon to unload a combine.  
To empty trailers, you can use the Giants Helper or AutoDrive.  
Starting the unloader requires a few things:  
- You need to have a single trailer or auger wagon attached. Multiple trailers are not supported.  
- Use the Target Icon on the HUD to select the field being harvested. The unloader will unload all Courseplay driven harvesters working on that field.  
- You must be on the field or within 20 meters of the field to start the unloader.  
  
Unloaders have only a few settings you can tweak:  
- You can set the fill level at which the unloader will consider itself full. This  
is to avoid waiting for a combine to call with a trailer almost full.  
- You can use the offsets in the HUD to adjust the position of the unloader under the harvester's pipe.  
  


## Using trailers

  
If you use a trailer to unload, there are two ways to transport your harvest to a silo or to a selling point: the Giants helper  
or AutoDrive.  
You can either use the AI Menu and create a Job, then by activating the Giants helper function and unload target at the  
bottom of the list, or by activation of the wheel icon on the HUD.  
In the latter case, you have to choose the unload station after the wheel icon turns blue.  
  
Emptying a trailer with AutoDrive works the same as using a loading wagon, check out the AutoDrive Tutorials on the Internet.  


## Using auger wagons

  
Auger wagons are very simple to use.  
Just like with trailers, you use the target icon to choose the field where you want to unload a combine or harvester.  
To start the unloader, place it again on the field or within 20 meters of the field.  
If the auger wagon is full, it automatically looks for a trailer on or near the field to overload into it.  
In case the trailer is full and the auger wagon still not empty, it will look for another trailer to unload to.  
Is no trailer available, it will continue to unload the combine.  


## Unload on the field

  
The unloading position can be selected with the unload marker.  
The position needs to be on the same field or near the field edge.  
If the marker points to an already existing heap,   
then this heap is used to unload to.  
The direction of the marker is used for the unload direction.  
Additionally for trailers a tipside needs to be selected.
