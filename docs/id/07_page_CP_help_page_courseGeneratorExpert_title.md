# Course generator: expert settings

  
Some settings are only visible, if you set the expert mode to active on the global Courseplay settings.  
Before you play around with those settings, you should make sure you know what the basic settings do.  
Some expert settings only work properly under some conditions.  
  
- Multiple tools: This setting is used when you want more than just one vehicle to work on your course. As this gets a bit more complicated, there is a separate help topic for it.  
- Switching lanes: With this option active, vehicles switch lanes at each turn, so every vehicle's turn is of the same width. See the extra help menu "Switching lanes" for more details.  
- Field margin: This setting lets you move the field border in- or outwards of the original border.  
- Narrow field: Creates the headland only at two short edges of the field. In that case, it is not possible to keep your vehicle on the field on the longest edges at the headland.  
- Headland overlap: By default, headland passes overlap each other (but never the field edge) by a few percent to avoid missing fruit in some edge cases. You can change that overlap here.  
- Use base line edge: With this setting you can generate curved up/down rows, running parallel with the edge of the field near the field marker. This makes sense when the field edge is not straight, the up/down rows will follow the curve of the edge.  
IMPORTANT NOTE: This is an experimental setting which may not work for all field shapes. If it doesn't work, try another setting.
