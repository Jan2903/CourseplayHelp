# Course generator: headland

  
Headland settings will only show up when you have set at least one headland.  
You'll have options for where to start on, corner settings, direction and overlap.  
Headlands are highly recommended to prevent tools leaving the field when turning.  


  
- Sharpen headland corners: Sharpen the corners of the headlands which are not rounded. Will force the vehicle to make a  
headland turn whenever the headland's curvature is less than the turning radius of the vehicle.  
- Number of round corners: Number of headlands, counting from the outermost one, that will have rounded corners. Rounded  
corners are based on the vehicle's turning radius, so for these headlands, the vehicle won't perform a turn maneuver in the corners.  
- Corner radius: Sets the radius for the round corners. If you know a following work tool have a minimum radius of 10, you may set this value to 10 for the course.  
- Headland direction: clockwise or counter-clockwise. This can be important for combines and harvesters, depending on  
which side the pipe or conveyor belt is.  
- Headland overlap: How much one headland overlaps with the next. This is to avoid missing fruit in some cases.
