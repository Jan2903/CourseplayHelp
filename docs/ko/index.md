# General Information

  
Courseplay allows you to generate field courses with additional features, for example: headlands.  
It also enables the usage of balers and foragewagons, that can be send on the same course, as a mower or harvester from before.  
Another big feature is the collecting or wraping of bales on the field.  
New with this iteration of CP is the vine fieldwork.  
Fieldwork courses can be setup in multitool mode, which allows the use of up to 5 driver working in a convoy on the same field.  
It's also possible to have the combine unload in a trailer on/near the field automatically.  
Custom fieldborders can be assigned for courseplay to use, for example: in case of a meadow, which isn't recognised as a normal field.  
Lastly cp has a interface for Autodrive, which allows for refilling of a seeder at a nearby silo or unloading a foragewagon and so on.

There you can get help or report any issue you've experienced.

What is the expert Mode:  
When the expert Mode is deactivated, you have only access to some settings.  
The other settings are hidden and set to default values, which works in most situations.  
That way, we try to help Users to get easier into Courseplay without being overwhelmed from all the settings.
