# Custom Fields


There are two ways to create a custom field.
The first one is to use the record function of the HUD.
Start the record and record your field border.
Once done, press the button again and you will be asked if you want to save it.

When started, the text draw custom field lines with right click will be displayed.
Use the right mouse button to click on a position on where you want to start.
The next right click will draw a line from your startpoint to your second position, wich will be the start point for the next line.
