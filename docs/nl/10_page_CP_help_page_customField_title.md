# Custom Fields

  
There are two ways to create a custom field.  
The first one is to use the record function of the HUD.  
Start the record and record your field border.  
Once done, press the button again and you will be asked if you want to save it.

Having a look on the AI Menu, you will see your recorded field border.  
By clicking on the Name, you will get the option to either delete it or rename it.  


  
The second option is to draw the custom field on the map of the CP AI menu.  
To start the drawing, hit they button on the bottom left corner or hit corresponding key.  
After that a text appears on the top of your screen.  
Start by clicking the right mouse button for setting the start position.  
By holding the shift key, the line will be set straight in 90Â° angles.  
The next clicks will create lines to the previous click.  
Once you draw a second line, the course will be automatically closed. You can still draw more lines to define the field even further.  
You don't need to draw the last line to the start, as it gets generated automatically straight to the start.
