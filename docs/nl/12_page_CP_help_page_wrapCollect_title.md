# Bale wrapping and collecting  
Wrapping and collecting bales can be done in two different ways.  
The first one is to load the same course you used for your baler and let the wrapper or collector run that course.  
However this can be tricky, as some bales love to roll or fly off the path.  
At this point, our wrap and collect job type can help as it doesn't need a course.  
Stay on the field and just start the driver from the HUD with wrap/collect bales or use the AI Map to send him to a field to start the job.  


  
Wrapping bales is very simple. Load a course of your baler and start like any other Fieldwork Job, or without a course,  
start it with bale wrapping/collecting from the HUD or the AI Menu.  


  
When using a course, the helper drives with a preset offset so the wrappers pickup is in the middle of the course.  
Without a course, the Courseplay scans the field for unwrapped bales and uses the pathfinder to find a way to  
the best closest bale to wrap.  
Automatic backing up if a bale is in front of the vehicle or if we are too close to the field border should prevent accidents.  


  
Collecting bales works kinda the same, with or without a course.  
When the collector is full, it will stop the work and tells the user it needs to be unloaded. If you have AutoDrive  
installed you can use it to run an unload the bale collector automatically.
