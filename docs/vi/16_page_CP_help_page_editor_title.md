# Course editor

  
The course editor can be used to edit courses and custom fields.  
The loaded courses will be saved/overwritten automatically, when the editor is closed.  
  
1) Editing a custom field can be done by selecting one on the ai menu page and clicking on edit custom field.  
2) Editing a course can be done in the course manager by selecting it and clicking on open course editor.   
   This only works with saved courses. Make sure no course is loaded in the vehicle.  
  
Editing of courses should only be done, when the course generator couldn't produce a good enough course.  
Incorrect editing might cause problems for the driver, as the waypoints have hidden attributes.  


  
Under the basic category are:  
1) Moving of a grabbed waypoint.  
2) Inserting waypoints ahead or behind of the waypoint that you click on.  
  
Deleting of waypoints can be done with the red delete button.  


  
Under the advanced category are:  
1) A brush to set the turn attribute of a waypoint (only with a course and not a custom field).  
Clicking multiple times on the waypoint will toggle between "normal" (orange), "turn start" (green) and "turn end" (red).  
  
2) A brush to move multiple waypoints in between to selected waypoints.  
To do this, you mark 2 Waypoints with the left mouse button, then by holding the left mouse button, you can move all waypoints in between including the marked ones.  
To unmark the waypoints, click the right mouse button.  
  
3) A brush to insert a curve of waypoints between two selected waypoints.  
Just like moving more waypoints, mark 2 waypoints, then hold the left mouse button and move the mouse.  
Attention: As soon as you release the mouse button, the waypoints will be set, this can't be undone! (of course you can delete those waypoints.)
