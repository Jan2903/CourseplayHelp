# Custom Fields

  
There are two ways to create custom fields.  
The first one is to use the record function of the HUD.  
First press the course record button and then drive the field border that you want to record.  
Once your finished, simply press the button again and you will be asked if you want to save it.  
Start and End should not overlap!

The custom field borders will be displayed in the AI menu.  
By clicking on the name you will get the option to either delete, rename or edit it with the editor.  


  
The second option is to draw the custom field on the map of the CP AI menu.  
To start the drawing, click the button in the bottom-left corner or press the corresponding key.  
After that a text appears on the top of your screen.  
Start by clicking the right mouse button for setting the start position.  
By holding the shift key, the line will be set straight in 90Â° angles.  
The next clicks will create lines to the previous click.  
Once you draw a second line, the course will be automatically closed. You can still draw more lines to define the field even further.  
You don't need to draw the last line to the start, as it gets generated automatically straight to the start.
