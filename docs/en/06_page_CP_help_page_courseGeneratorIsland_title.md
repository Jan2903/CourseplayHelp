# Course generator: islands

  
Courseplay will generate headlands around islands when island bypass is enabled, so when the course first encounters an island, it will make at least one full circle around it.  
You can set the number of headlands (thus the number of circles) around the island if you need more room for vehicles turning at the island.  
Keep in mind that the generator may decide to generate fewer headlands if the island is too close to the field boundary.  

  
- Island bypass: Turns on or off the bypass of the island, if an island is found. This does not work for custom fields!  
- Island headlands: The number of rounds around the island can be set independently of the headland setting.  
- Island headland direction: In which direction the driver drives around the island, for instance, to make sure the combine's pipe is not in the fruit or to not have strange direction changes.
