# Multitool and Convoy


It is possible to have up to 5 vehicles working together on the same field in a group (also called multi tools course).
You can switch the position (lane) of the vehicle in the group on the HUD (left-center-right).



Once a multi tool course is loaded you will need to select the position (lane) for the driver.
Those lanes are always named the same:
left(2), left(1), center, right(1), right(2).
2 vehicles have left(1) and right(1), 4 have left(2) and right(2) as well.
With 3 or 5 vehicles there is a center option as well.
Selecting a different lane also updates the course display to show the actual course for that vehicle.



The convoy only works if the vehicles have the same multi tool course with the same name loaded.
They will automatically keep a small distance towards the vehicle in front of.
Additionally, the convoy feature also gets applied when for example a baler is driving behind a combine on the same course.



The convoy distance vehicle setting changes the distance between the vehicles.
The distance of all vehicles with the same course name will be automatically set to the highest value of all vehicles in the convoy.
