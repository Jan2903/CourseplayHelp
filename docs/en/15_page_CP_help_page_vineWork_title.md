# Vine work

  
Working on vines is a bit more complex than working on a normal field.  
To have the best result, the vines should all be next to each other within the default grid.  
The end and start of each vine, should also be approximately the same length.  
If the vines are on an existing field, you can open the generator the direct way like normal.  
If they are not on a field, you have to go over the AI Menu and place the field marker on the vines.  


  
The generator for vines has fewer options.  
Depending on the tool, you have to choose to work on the vines or beside the vines.  
E.g. the default harvester needs to drive and work on the vine.  
     The pre-pruner needs to drive left from the vines but works on the vine, so you have to choose to work on the vine, but drive with an offset.  
     Sprayers need to drive next to the vines and need to skip one row, since it sprays to the left and the right.

A vine course should be generated on the vines, as it got to drive and work on the vines.

The pre-pruner works on the vines, so the course has to be generated on the vines.  
The tool comes with an offset for the tractor, so the tractor drives between the vines.

The sprayer works next to the vines, so it has to drive either left or right from the vines.  
Since the sprayer can work on the left and right vines at the same time, we can skip a row.
