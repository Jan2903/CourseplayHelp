# Course Generator Basics

  
Courseplay's course generator is a sophisticated tool that can generate fieldwork courses customized for every possible job.  
It has many settings and it may take some time to familiarize yourself with it.   
If you are new to Courseplay, you should probably start playing with the number of headlands first and then venture into the more advanced settings.  
After changing a parameter, hit Generate to see what impact the setting has.   
The best way to explore all the possibilities the generator offers is to experiment with it.  

  
Basics:  
The first few values you see here are real basic stuff.  
  
- Work width: Courseplay automatically detects the working width for most tools, so you won't have to worry about this,  
but if automatic detection fails, you can set it manually. This setting has an impact on the overall course.  
- Number of headlands: The best way to keep your vehicles on the field while turning at the end of each row is to add headlands.  
The Number of the Headlands multiplied by the work width should be at least the total length of your vehicle plus the attached tool.  
- Start work on: As mentioned in the extended AI Menu, the field position is used to set the start or end position for the fieldwork course.  
You want to start working on the headland when harvesting, and work towards the middle of the field.  
Plowing, sowing and cultivating should start in the center of the field and work towards the headland.
