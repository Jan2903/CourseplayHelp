# General Information

  
Courseplay allows you to generate field courses with additional features, for example: headlands.  
It also enables the usage of balers and forage wagons, that can be send on the same course, as a mower or harvester from before.  
Another big feature is the collecting or wrapping of bales on the field.  
Courseplay is also able to work on rice fields and vines.  
Fieldwork courses can be setup in multitool mode, which allows the use of up to 5 driver working in a convoy on the same field.  
It's also possible to have the combine unload in a trailer on/near the field automatically.  
Custom field borders can be assigned for Courseplay to use, for example: in case of a meadow, which isn't recognised as a normal field.  
Lastly CP has an interface for AutoDrive, which allows for refilling of a seeder at a nearby silo or unloading a forage wagon and so on.  
Combine unloaders are able to create a heap near the field with their loaded fruit.  
In Farming Simulator 25, Courseplay got its own menu, which you can access over different buttons on the HUD.  
  
For more information please visit our GitHub: https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS25 .  
There you can get help or report any issues you've experienced.  
Finally, we thank every translator and our community for reporting bugs, giving use feedback and new ideas.  
  
What is the expert mode:  
When the expert mode is deactivated, you only have access to some settings.  
The other settings are hidden and set to default values, which work in most situations.  
That way, we try to make it easier for new Courseplay users to get started without overwhelming them with the various settings.
