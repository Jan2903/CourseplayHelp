# Extended AI Menu


Helper settings are now under our own new "Helper settings" menu.
It works much like the old AI Menu.
Select a vehicle in the AI menu for creating a job, based on the attached tools or selected vehicle.
Beside the map and the job settings, you will find the settings for the course generator and vine course generator at the top. Those are only accessible with a valid tool when you are creating a job.
For generating a course and starting the Courseplay jobs, you will need to create the job CP: Fieldwork with a valid tool or vehicle.
Tip: To gain quicker access, you can click on "no course" on the HUD. This will bring you to the menu with a job already created for the vehicle.

To start off with your first CP job, you would have to select a vehicle and a possible valid implement which is supported for the job.
Then, by clicking on create job, you can select a CP job for your selected tool or vehicle.



With a CP job selected, you would need to place the field position on a field for generating the course or using the bale finder on it.
The position also roughly controls the starting point of your course.
If you want to use the Giants helper to drive to the field, then you also need to set the target position close to the starting point of the course.
The lane offset setting is only used if you want to have multiple helpers working on the same field. For this please check out the separate help menu page below.
Tip: If you stand already on the field when you click on "no course" to enter the menu, the markers are already placed.

When the field position is placed correctly on a field, you will see the field border drawn on the map.
If you are creating a CP: Fieldwork job, you will gain access to the course generator settings. 



Now it's possible to start the driver directly from the menu. The Giants helper will drive to the target position and from there the CP job automatically takes over.
Alternatively you can also start the driver from the HUD if you are close to the field with the vehicle or using the AutoDrive mod to deliver the CP job close to the field.
