# Silo loading

  
You can use this job with a Ropa Maus or similar to pick up heaps on or near the field and unload into a Courseplay unloader.  
Additionally, it's possible to load from a bunker silo.  
  
If you let Courseplay drive directly to the heap, it unfolds in a default position to load the heap.  
In case this position doesn't fit for your environment, you can stop the driver, change the position of the arm like normal and start the driver again.  
Keep in mind that the automatic unloading with CP goes in the same direction as the loader. Keep some space for the unloader to bypass the loader at the side.  


  
To start, the loading marker on the AI menu needs to be set.  
The marker detects heaps or silos and highlights them on the map.  
Now it's possible to start the helper.
